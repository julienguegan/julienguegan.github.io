Hello dear reader, you may have arrived here by mistake or by clicking on *ABOUT* without really knowing what that meant. Well, you will probably be disappointed to learn that this page is there to talk about the author of this blog, I named: **myself**.

Okay, so about me: I went to engineering school in applied mathematics and then specialized training in artificial intelligence. The technical subjects that interest me and that you can find in this blog are therefore about that, and as an engineer I often prefer to find a concrete and practical application to mathematics and leave the purely theoretical parts to researchers (who are better than me for that). So why did I create this blog? I think it's a good way to better appropriate ideas by having to describe them yourself. The blog allows me to have a support where to store my work and it forces me to always be curious about new technologies.
